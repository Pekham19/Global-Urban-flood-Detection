First You have to identify the location or city you want to see as a urban area.

Then Go back to that's past years if there any urban floods happened or not if yes get those coordinates.

mainly in Urban flood creation you have a dem of that location land use land cover rainfall etc data. 

Then in this machine learning code i have the past urban flood dataset and then i will create the non flood points as much as you can and mask the other area rather than the urban area using land use land cover and google maps etc.

Then i ran the these three dataset.

Using Random Forest Machine learning method for running it split into test and train then run the model. And Xgboost model then resample those two models for better result also the accuracy for random forest is 0.83 and Xgboost 0.82. 

If you don't see your result in Qgis after importing don't worry thats why i create this 'flood_quicklook_urban_only' in this png file you can see there that your tiff is exist or not.
